            <p>Hi, my name is Angie. I am absolutely passionate about coding; I love creating elegant and efficient code. I have always had a strong aptitude with and intuition for computer programs, and when I started creating my own applications as a database specialist, I knew that I wanted to pursue a career as a programmer. At Epicodus, a coding bootcamp, my coding, research, problem-solving and communication skills were greatly enhanced. Completing Epicodus, is evidence that I am smart, driven, a hard worker, and I know that I would be an excellent asset to have as part of any team. </p>
            <p>Below is a snapshot of my professional history and some projects that I'd like to show off. Thank you for taking the time to look at my portfolio!</p>
            <h3 class="headers">Professional History</h3>
            <p>Angela began programming as a database specialist in 2012. She worked primarily with Visual Basic and SQL to create Access and Excel databases as reporting tools. During this time, she took some classes to help her learn relational databases and object-oriented design, including computer science, SQL and VB.net. Apart from these classes, she learned on the job and developed great research and problem-solving skills.</p>
            <p>In 2016-2017, she attended Epicodus, a coding bootcamp. There, she developed a strong foundational knowledge of HTML5 and PHP, and learned the basics of a few programming frameworks, including Silex, Ember, Angular 2, and Drupal. Her research and problem-solving skills were also greatly enhanced. </p>
            <p>After her training, she was placed as a software development intern at Fuel Medical. At Fuel, she learned another framework, Vue.js, and continued to develop her understanding and knowledge of PHP.</p>
            <!-- <p>I am absolutely passionate about programming. Most of my professional career has been in administrative and customer service, but I got a taste of programming as a database specialist. In this position, I had many years of experience developing Access and Excel databases. I took several classes in computer science and came to understand relational databases and object-oriented design. Because I had to learn on the job and didnâ€™t have many resources other than the internet to figure out how to do the things requested, I developed great research and debugging skills and was able to accomplish most of the goals that were set before me. I fell in love with programming, and wanted to learn more in order to begin my career as a software developer.</p> -->
            <!-- <p>When I discovered Epicodus, a coding bootcamp, I jumped at the chance. There, I learned the fundamentals about programming in HTML5 but focused on PHP and Javascript. My research and problem-solving skills were enhanced because the curriculum provided a broad understanding of the material but the projects were more complicated. The pair-programming learning format taught us to work together to gain a deeper understanding of the material through research. It also enforced great communication skills.  At the end of our training, I was provided with an internship opportunity as a software developer where my desire to program was very much reinforced.</p> -->
