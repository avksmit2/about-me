            <h3 class="headers">Professional History</h3>
            <p>I am absolutely passionate about programming. Most of my professional career has been in administrative and customer service, but I got a taste of programming as a database specialist. In this position, I had many years of experience developing Access and Excel databases. I took several classes in computer science and came to understand relational databases and object-oriented design. Because I had to learn on the job and didnâ€™t have many resources other than the internet to figure out how to do the things requested, I developed great research and debugging skills and was able to accomplish most of the goals that were set before me. I fell in love with programming, and wanted to learn more in order to begin my career as a software developer.</p>
            <p>When I discovered Epicodus, a coding bootcamp, I jumped at the chance. There, I learned the fundamentals about programming in HTML5 but focused on PHP and Javascript. My research and problem-solving skills were enhanced because the curriculum provided a broad understanding of the material but the projects were more complicated. The pair-programming learning format taught us to work together to gain a deeper understanding of the material through research. It also enforced great communication skills.  At the end of our training, I was provided with an internship opportunity as a software developer where my desire to program was very much reinforced.</p>
